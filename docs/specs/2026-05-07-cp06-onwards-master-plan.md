# CP-06 onwards — Master plan for 33 canonical scenarios

Living document. Updated as canonicals ship.

## Goal

Expand from CP-01..CP-05 (5 verified pick-place canonicals) to **33 canonicals** covering all major industrial manipulation patterns. Each canonical is a deterministic build template (`workspace/templates/CP-NN.json`) that the orchestrator's hard-instantiate path matches against user prompts.

## Decision: scope, role, ordering

- **Role of CP-N system**: retrieval-fallback for general manipulation prompts (B), with secondary value as honesty-test substrate (D). Not optimizing for G1-pipeline scaffolding (C) since that's a separate Phase 9 axis Kimate drives himself.
- **Build order**: cluster by shared tools, build cheap ones first to validate reverse-engineer flow, save tool-novel ones for after the simple ports prove the pipeline.
- **Cap on ambition**: 33 scenarios is the goal; if we hit hard physics-tuning issues (CP-05-style), document and probe-mark rather than block.

## Phase plan (5 sprints)

### Sprint 1 — Trivial ports (CP-06, CP-07, CP-08)
**Goal**: validate reverse-engineering flow with no new tools.
**Canonicals**:
- CP-06: UR10PickPlace — port `/standalone_examples/.../universal_robots/pick_place.py`, ~10 tool calls
- CP-07: CobottaPro900PickPlace — same shape, Denso 6-DoF arm
- CP-08: FrankaRoboFactory — 4× parallel Franka stacking; tests `clone_envs` offset

**Output**: 3 new canonicals, function-gate verified, hard-instantiate matched.

### Sprint 2 — Tier A tool burst
**Goal**: build `compute_stack_placement` + `add_vision_classifier_gate` (+ `setup_robot_claim_mutex` if time). Each unlocks 4-7 canonicals.
**Tool builds**:
1. `compute_stack_placement(target_path, layer_pattern, cube_size)` — emits placement coords for layered/columnar stacking. Used by 7 scenarios.
2. `add_vision_classifier_gate(camera_path, class_to_destination)` — wraps `vision_detect_objects` in routing state machine. Used by 6.
3. `setup_robot_claim_mutex(robots, claim_table_attr)` — shared-resource arbitration. Used by 4.

**Canonicals enabled (6+ new)**:
- CP-09: Inspect-and-Reject Divert (vision gate)
- CP-10: Vision Quality Gate 3-path
- CP-11: Size+Color 4-Class Sorter (vision gate × 2 axes)
- CP-12: Nested-Box Packer (stack placement + count gate)
- CP-13: Graduated Tower (stack placement + priority sort)
- CP-14: Pinwheel Palletizer (stack placement + gap forbidden zone)

### Sprint 3 — Surface gripper + Cortex cluster
**Goal**: support suction/vacuum end-effectors + Cortex behavior trees.
**Tool builds**:
1. `surface_gripper(robot_path, attach_offset)` — vacuum/magnetic adhesion (4 scenarios)
2. `setup_cortex_behavior(robot, behavior_module, obstacles, task_class)` — Kit-safe wrapper around `world.step()` (3 scenarios)
3. `set_gripper_rotation(robot, yaw_deg)` — wrist rotation for layer-alternating palletizing (3)
4. `register_moving_obstacle(robot, obstacle_prim)` — Cortex dynamic-obstacle pattern (2)

**Canonicals enabled (4 new)**:
- CP-15: UR10BinFilling (gravity dispenser + surface gripper)
- CP-16: SurfaceGripperGantry (linear-axis robot + surface gripper)
- CP-17: FrankaCortexBlockStacking (Cortex framework first port)
- CP-18: UR10BinStacking (Cortex + conveyor + dynamic spawn + flip station)

### Sprint 4 — Multi-robot coordination cluster
**Goal**: build coordination primitives that several scenarios share.
**Tool builds**:
1. `setup_robot_handoff_signal(giver, receiver, transfer_pose)` — force/signal-triggered dual-grip handoff (3)
2. `create_kit_tray(tray_path, slot_layout)` + `track_slot_occupancy(tray_path)` — kitting (3 scenarios paired)
3. `create_articulated_joint(joint_path, parent, child, type, axis, limits, drive)` — drawer, rotary table, active flipper (2+)

**Canonicals enabled (6 new)**:
- CP-19: Kitting Multi-Source-to-Tray
- CP-20: Two-Cell Kit-Tray Relay (NIST)
- CP-21: Fixed-Point Robot-to-Robot Handoff
- CP-22: Producer/Consumer Bounded Buffer
- CP-23: Leader/Follower Rotary Station
- CP-24: Recipe-Based Kitting

### Sprint 5 — Specialty + advanced
**Goal**: remaining one-off tools, complex scenarios.
**Tool builds (per scenario)**:
- `add_force_torque_sensor` (peg-in-hole)
- `setup_assembly_constraint` (peg-in-hole)
- `barcode_reader_sensor` (postal sorter)
- `nir_material_sensor` (recycling)
- `load_rl_policy` (drawer)
- `setup_grasp_pose_sampler` (grasp SDG)
- `setup_nav_robot` (mixed fleet)

**Canonicals enabled (9 new)**:
- CP-25: Peg-in-Hole Insertion Array
- CP-26: Postal Cross-Belt Sorter
- CP-27: Recycling Multi-Sensor Stream Splitter
- CP-28: FrankaDrawerOpen (RL policy + articulated joint)
- CP-29: GraspingWorkflowSDG
- CP-30: RoboParty (mixed fleet)

- CP-34: Mixed-SKU Palletizing Column
- CP-35: Parcel Singulation + Heap (`create_heap_zone`)

(Numbering: CP-25..CP-38 — adjust as we ship.)

## Composition DAG

User insight: canonicals can **combine** to generate novel scenes. Match-spectrum T3 ("Composed") is the agent's path forward when no single canonical exactly matches.

Edges:
- CP-01 (assembly line) + CP-03 (color sort) → CP-09 (color-routed assembly with reject lane)
- CP-04 (compact) + CP-25 (peg-in-hole) → compact assembly cell
- CP-15 (gravity dispenser) + CP-19 (kitting) → multi-fed kitting station
- CP-02 (relay) + CP-09 (vision gate) → quality-checked relay (good cubes pass through, bad rejected mid-relay)
- CP-17 (Cortex) + CP-25 (peg-in-hole) → Cortex-controlled assembly
- CP-29 (grasp SDG) + any pickplace canonical → SDG dataset for that task

The orchestrator's hard-instantiate path needs T3 logic: when no canonical matches > threshold, retrieve top-K matches and propose a **composition** (which 2-3 canonicals chained or merged covers the prompt).

## Verification per canonical

Each shipped canonical:
- ✅ Build via `execute_template_canonical` — n_ok = n_calls
- ✅ Form-gate via `verify_pickplace_pipeline` — pipeline_ok=true
- ✅ Function-gate via `simulate_traversal_check` — cube delivered
- ✅ Hard-instantiate match via `template_retriever` — sim ≥ 0.45, margin ≥ 0.20
- ✅ Multi-cube delivery via `function_gate_multi_cube` (where applicable)
- ✅ Visual review by user

**2026-05-07/2026-05-08 progress** — 19 atomic commits since structural work began. Smoke regression (6 fixtures) green throughout:

- **Phase A (settle_state)** — 9 commits. Replaced regex-based settle extraction with structural `settle_state` JSON field (kcode-spec sec 4 anti-fragility). CP-01..CP-05 migrated; CP-07 unblocked; CP-06 postponed.
- **Phase B (Tier A tool + canonicals)** — 10 commits:
  - **`compute_stack_placement` v1+v2** — pure-data placement computer. Patterns: `column`, `grid_RxC`, `donut_RxC` (RxC minus center). Tier A — 7 scenarios depend.
  - **`drop_targets` dict in cuRobo handler** — per-cube drop position dispatch. Falls through to drop_target → DEST_PATH bbox center for unmapped cubes. `_compute_h1` extended to clear all targets.
  - **4 new canonicals**: CP-08, CP-09, CP-10, CP-11 — all form-gate-verified, all using the new tool stack.
  - **function_gate_suite** extended with CP-08 (expect_pass=True) and CP-09 (probe).

**Function-gate observation**: stack-placement canonicals appear stochastic on cuRobo single-runs — consistent with T4-stochastic memory. Future work: N-of-M acceptance threshold + per-canonical seed-stability tuning.

**Postponed (Sprint 3)**: CP-06 builtin handler (FixedJoint integration), `add_vision_classifier_gate` (Tier A #2 tool — 6 scenarios depend), per-cube cube_size for mixed-SKU palletizers.
